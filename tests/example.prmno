// This is an example of my ParamNO esolang
// Comments can be made with double lines like in JavaScript
// But you can't append a comment to a line of actual code, so make sure you are on a new line.


// This function called "GOO" Should never run
FUNC goo
PRINT
-TEXT Huh? This isn't supposed to run

// Any line starting with "FUNC" will become a new function. It must have a name.

// Say you wanted to print something, you would have the PRINT function, then following that, parameters starting with a -
// Most parameters have to start with something like "TEXT" or "VAR" depending on what it's referring to.
// Parameters are jumbled though and scrambled, as that is the base concept of this esolang


FUNC MAIN

// The MAIN function is always called first.


// Here we set the variable GOO to GOO and print it.

SET
-TEXT GOO
-TEXT GOO

PRINT
-VAR GOO

IF
-TEXT GOO
-TEXT GOO
-TEXT GOO

PRINT
-TEXT "GOO" is not "GOO" for some reason

// Here we use a workaround for the IF statement
// Because all parameters are jumbled, it's better if all the parameters are the same. You can't do much that way but it makes sure that it runs 100% of the time.

//IF the text "GOO" is equal to "GOO" then we go to the function called "TEXT GOO". When you go to a function, it cancels all the other lines after it.

FUNC TEXT GOO

PRINT
-TEXT Yes, "GOO" is in fact "GOO"
